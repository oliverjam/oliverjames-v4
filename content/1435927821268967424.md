    alt: Screenshot of a JavaScript function that finds all the focusable children of an element. It uses the new `:scope` and `:is` CSS features to target just the direct children that match a list of focusable elements.

    alt: Screenshot of a JavaScript function that finds all the focusable children of an element. To target only direct children of the element it must ensure the element has an ID, then use that in the CSS selector. It must also map over the list of focusable elements to create a long list of each selector preceded by the ID.
